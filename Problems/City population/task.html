  <p>Imagine we want to implement the <code class="java">City</code> class, which stores the name of the city and its population.</p> 
  <p>According to the real-life rules, there are some restrictions. If the number is out of range, it's corrected: the population of the city will be zero for less than zero and&nbsp;50 million for greater than <code class="java">50_000_000</code>.</p> 
  <p>Finish the implementation of&nbsp;<code class="java">City</code> class that will follow this logic.</p>
