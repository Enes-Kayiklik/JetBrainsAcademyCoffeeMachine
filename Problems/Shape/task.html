  <p>Write a program, which reads the number of the shape (1 – square, 2 – circle, 3 – triangle, 4 – rhombus) and prints the text "<strong><span style="color: #66cc66;">You have chosen a square</span></strong>" (or circle, or triangle, or rhombus, depending on the number). If the input is a number, that doesn't correspond to any of the listed shapes, the program is to output: "<strong><span style="color: #66cc66;">There is no such shape!</span></strong>".</p> 
  <p><strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">Note</span>: </strong>the&nbsp;output text should <strong>exactly</strong> match the sample! It's true for letters&nbsp;case and location of spaces as well.</p>
