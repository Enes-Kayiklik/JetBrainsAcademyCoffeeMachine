  <p>A detector compares the size of parts produced by a machine with the reference standard.</p> 
  <p>If the size of the part is <strong>larger</strong>, it can be sent to be fixed, and the detector prints the number 1.<br> If the size of the part is <strong>smaller</strong>, it is removed as reject, and the detector prints the number -1.<br> If the part is&nbsp;<strong>perfect</strong>, it is sent to the box with ready products, and the detector prints 0.</p> 
  <p>Write a program, which takes the number of parts <strong><em>n</em></strong> as input, and then the sequence of detector prints. The program is to output three&nbsp;numbers in a single line â€“ the number of ready parts, the number of parts to&nbsp;fix, and the number of rejects.</p>
